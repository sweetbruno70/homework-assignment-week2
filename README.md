# homework-assignment-week2 - Henry Ventura's Portfolio

This is my first attempt at creating a webpage without any starter code. This site was created to fulfill the University of Berkley's Coding Bootcamp Homework requirements, and to understand the intricacies of CSS styling and HTML design.

Collaborators: The creation of this webpage would not have been possible without the tutelage of my instructor Samantha Randolph and several classmates, including Neil Kirkpatrick, who provided essential feeback durin group work. 

The website depicted in this project intends to showcase my Nursing background and my novice website design skills.
