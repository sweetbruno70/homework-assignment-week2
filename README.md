# homework-assignment-week2 - Henry Ventura's Portfolio

This is my first attempt of creating a webpage without any starter code. This site was created to fulfill the University of Berkley's Coding Bootcamp Homework 2, and to understand the intricacies of CSS styling and HTML design.

Collaborators: The creation of this webpage would not have been possible without the tutelage of my instructor Samantha Randolph and several classmates, including Neil Kirkpatrick, who provided essential feeback during lectures and group work. 

The website depicted in this project intends to showcase my Nursing background and my novice website design skills.
